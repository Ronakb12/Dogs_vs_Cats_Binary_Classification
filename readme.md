Raw images to classification with Convolutional Neural Network

We're going to be running through taking raw images that have been labeled for us already, and then feeding them through a convolutional neural network for classification.

The images are either of dog(s) or cat(s).

Once you have downloaded and extracted the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data, you're ready to begin.
